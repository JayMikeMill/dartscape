TO WIN A <font fgcolor='#FF44FF44'>SET</font> A PLAYER MUST WIN THE <font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>BEST OF</font> THE SET NUMBER OF LEGS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE NUMBER OF LEGS IN A SET IS 5, THE FIRST PLAYER TO WIN 3 LEGS WINS THE SET. THIS IS THE SAME FOR MULTIPLE SETS.

    <string name="help_x01_scoring">TO START SCORING THE PLAYER MUST MEET THE GAME \"<font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>IN</font>\" VARIANT REQUIREMENT (SEE BELOW). ALL NUMBERS ARE IN PLAY INCLUDING BULLSEYE. THE PLAYER CAN HIT A <font fgcolor='#FF44FF44'>SINGLE</font>, <font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>DOUBLE</font> OR <font fgcolor='#FFFFBB00'>TRIPLE</font> OF ANY NUMBER. THE NUMBER IS THEN MULTIPLIED AND SUBTRACTED FROM THEIR SCORE. TO WIN, THE PLAYER\'S SCORE MUST REACH EXACTLY ZERO AND MEET THE GAME \"<font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>OUT</font>\" VARIANT REQUIREMENT (SEE BELOW). IF THE PLAYER\'S SCORE GOES BELOW ZERO, THE PLAYER\'S TURN ENDS AND THEIR SCORE RETURNS TO WHAT IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR TURN. THIS IS CALLED A <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>BUST</font>. A GOOD STRATEGY IS TO AIM FOR THE HIGHEST SCORING NUMBER (<font fgcolor='#FFFFBB00'>TRIPLE 20</font>) UNTIL THE PLAYER IS IN SCORING RANGE TO WIN.</string>

    <string name="help_cricket_scoring">TO SCORE, THE PLAYER MUST HIT ANY OF THE ACTIVE NUMBERS (15 THROUGH 20 OR THE <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>BULLSEYE</font>). THE PLAYER CAN HIT A <font fgcolor='#FF44FF44'>SINGLE</font>, <font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>DOUBLE</font> OR <font fgcolor='#FFFFBB00'>TRIPLE</font> OF ANY NUMBER. WHEN THE PLAYER HITS A NUMBER THEY GET A MARK ON THAT NUMBER REPRESENTED BY A SLASH \"<font fgcolor='#FFFFFFFF'> / </font>\" ON THE SCORE SHEET. WHEN A PLAYER GETS THEIR THIRD MARK ON A NUMBER, THEY \"<font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>CLOSE</font>\" IT. THIS IS REPRESENTED BY A CIRCLE \"<font fgcolor='#FFFFFFFF'>〇</font>\" ON THE SCORE SHEET. ONCE A PLAYER <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>CLOSES</font> A NUMBER THEY CAN BEGIN TO START SCORING ON THAT NUMBER. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A PLAYER HITS A TRIPLE 20 AND A DOUBLE 20, THEY WOULD CLOSES THE NUMBER AND SCORE ON THE DOUBLE 20 (40 POINTS). WHEN ALL PLAYERS CLOSE A NUMBER THE NUMBER BECOMES <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>INACTIVE</font>. <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>INACTIVE</font> NUMBERS CAN NO LONGER BE HIT TO SCORE.</string>

WHEN A PLAYER SCORES ON A NUMBER, ALL OTHER PLAYERS WHO <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>DO NOT</font> HAVE THAT NUMBER <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>CLOSED</font> WILL ACCUMULATE THE SCORE. IF ANOTHER PLAYER HAS ALREADY CLOSED THAT NUMBER, THEIR SCORE IS <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>UNAFFECTED</font>.\n\n<font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>SCORE CAP</font>\nA SCORE CAP CAN BE ADDED TO THE GAME TO PREVENT PLAYERS FROM ACCUMULATING VERY HIGH SCORES, FORCING THEM TO MOVE ON TO OTHER NUMBERS. PLAYERS CAN ONLY SCORE UP TO THE SCORE CAP PLUS THE LOWEST SCORING PLAYER\'S SCORE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE SCORE CAP IS SET TO 100 AND PLAYER 1 HAS A SCORE OF 134, AND PLAYER 2 HAS A SCORE OF 19, PLAYER 1 CAN ONLY SCORE UP TO 119 POINT BEFORE HE MUST MOVE ON.\n\n<font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>OPEN/TURN SCORING</font>\nOPEN SCORING MODE LETS PLAYERS KEEP SCORE WITHOUT HITTING \"NEXT TURN\".

WHEN THE LAST NUMBER IS FINISHED THE GAME ENDS AND THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE WINS. IF THERE IS A TIE, THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST <font fgcolor='#FFFFBB00'>TRIPLES</font> WINS.

    <string name="help_baseball_object">THE OBJECT OF BASEBALL IS TO HAVE THE MOST <font fgcolor='#FF44FF44'>RUNS</font> AT THE END OF THE GAME.</string>
    <string name="help_baseball_scoring">IN BASEBALL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF <font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>INNINGS</font>, WHICH ARE LIKE ROUNDS. EACH INNING, THE PLAYER MUST THROW AT THE NUMBER WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE INNING. FOR INSTANCE, DURING THE 1ST INNING, THE PLAYERS THROW AT THE 1, 2ND INNING, THE 2, AND SO ON. A PLAYER CAN SCORE ON A <font fgcolor='#FF44FF44'>SINGLE</font>, <font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>DOUBLE</font> OR <font fgcolor='#FFFFBB00'>TRIPLE</font> OF THAT NUMBER. THE PLAYER CAN ALSO SCORE ON THE <font fgcolor='#FF44FF44'>SINGLE BULLSEYE</font>  (THE <font fgcolor='#FF44FF44'>GREEN</font> AREA OF THE BULLSEYE). IF A PLAYER SCORES A SINGLE, IT IS LIKE A SINGLE IN BASEBALL, ALL RUNNERS ON BASE ADVANCE 1 BASE AND THEY GET A RUNNER ON 1ST BASE. THE SAME GOES FOR DOUBLES AND TRIPLE. THE SINGLE BULLSEYE COUNTS AS A HOME RUN, WHERE ALL RUNNERS ADVANCE TO THE <font fgcolor='#FFFFBB00'>HOME PLATE</font>. WHEN A RUNNER ADVANCES THE THE HOME PLATE, THE PLAYER GETS A <font fgcolor='#FF44FF44'>RUN</font>, REPRESENTED BY THEIR SCORE. IF A PLAYER DOES NOT HIT ANY PART OF THE ACTIVE NUMBER, OR THEY HIT THE <font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>DOUBLE BULLSEYE</font> (THE <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>RED</font> AREA OF THE BULLSEYE), THE THROW IS COUNTED AS AN <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>OUT</font>. AFTER THE PLAYER GETS 3 <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>OUTS</font>, THEIR TURN IS OVER AND THE NEXT PLAYER BEGINS. AFTER THE LAST TURN OF THE LAST INNING, THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST RUNS WINS.

TO BEGIN <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>KILLING</font> OTHER PLAYERS, THE PLAYER MUST FIRST HIT THE <font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>DOUBLE</font> OF THEIR OWN NUMBER. WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE PLAYER THEN BECOMES A <font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>KILLER</font> (BY TAPPING THEIR \"<font fgcolor='#FFFF6969'>KILLER</font>\" BUTTON). NOW THE PLAYER CAN BEGIN AIMING AT AND HITTING THE <font fgcolor='#FF66AAFF'>DOUBLES</font> OF OTHER PLAYER\'S NUMBERS.
